# Contributing to Call Analysis System

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Call Analysis System! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üéØ How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

- **Bug reports** - Help us identify and fix issues
- **Feature requests** - Suggest new functionality or improvements
- **Code contributions** - Implement features, fix bugs, or improve performance
- **Documentation** - Improve docs, add examples, or write tutorials
- **Testing** - Add tests, improve test coverage, or test new features

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** - Look for existing issues or discussions about your idea
2. **Create an issue** - For significant changes, create an issue to discuss your approach
3. **Fork the repository** - Create your own fork to work on

## üöÄ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- OpenAI API key (for testing AI features)

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/call-analysis.git
cd call-analysis

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your test configuration

# Start development services
./scripts/start-dev.sh
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch** for your feature/fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Run tests** to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

4. **Run code quality checks**:
   ```bash
   # Format code
   black src/ tests/
   
   # Check linting
   ruff check src/ tests/
   
   # Type checking
   mypy src/
   ```

5. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: your feature description"
   ```

6. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub

## üìù Coding Standards

### Code Style

We use these tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** for code formatting
- **Ruff** for linting
- **MyPy** for type checking
- **isort** for import sorting

### Code Guidelines

#### Python Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for all functions and methods
- Write comprehensive docstrings using Google style
- Keep functions focused and small (< 50 lines when possible)
- Use meaningful variable and function names

#### Example Function
```python
async def analyze_transcript(
    self, 
    transcript: str, 
    call_id: str,
    options: Optional[AnalysisOptions] = None
) -> CallInsight:
    """
    Analyze a call transcript and extract structured insights.
    
    Args:
        transcript: The call transcript text to analyze
        call_id: Unique identifier for the call
        options: Optional analysis configuration
        
    Returns:
        CallInsight object containing extracted information
        
    Raises:
        AnalysisError: If transcript analysis fails
        ValidationError: If input parameters are invalid
    """
    # Implementation here
```

#### Database Models
- Use descriptive table and column names
- Add proper indexes for query performance
- Include created_at and updated_at timestamps
- Use appropriate data types and constraints

#### API Design
- Follow RESTful conventions
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Provide clear API documentation
- Use Pydantic models for request/response validation

### Testing Guidelines

#### Test Structure
```python
# tests/test_analyzer.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, patch

from src.call_analysis.analyzer import SemanticTranscriptAnalyzer
from src.call_analysis.models import CallInsight


class TestSemanticTranscriptAnalyzer:
    """Test suite for SemanticTranscriptAnalyzer."""
    
    @pytest.fixture
    def analyzer(self):
        """Create analyzer instance for testing."""
        return SemanticTranscriptAnalyzer(api_key="test-key")
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_analyze_transcript_success(self, analyzer):
        """Test successful transcript analysis."""
        # Test implementation
        pass
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_analyze_transcript_api_error(self, analyzer):
        """Test handling of API errors."""
        # Test implementation
        pass
```

#### Test Categories
- **Unit tests** - Test individual functions/methods in isolation
- **Integration tests** - Test component interactions
- **API tests** - Test HTTP endpoints
- **Performance tests** - Test system performance under load

#### Test Requirements
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Use meaningful test names that describe what's being tested
- Mock external dependencies (OpenAI API, database, etc.)
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions
